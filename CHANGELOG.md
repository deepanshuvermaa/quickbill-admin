### Database Connection Debugging - Learning from Mistakes

#### Issue: Android app login failing with "Internal Server Error"

**Initial (Overcomplicated) Analysis:**
- Spent time analyzing IPv6 connection timeouts
- Investigated desktop app changes as potential cause
- Reviewed connection pooling configurations
- Analyzed package-lock.json changes
- Considered reverting to previous commits
- Proposed complex fixes with retry logic and connection optimizations

**Actual Root Cause:**
- **PostgreSQL database service was simply offline on Railway**
- Database wasn't deployed/running

#### Key Lesson: Always Check the Basics First

This debugging session highlights a critical oversight in problem-solving approach:

1. **Start with infrastructure status** - Is the service actually running?
2. **Check deployment status** - Is the database deployed?
3. **Verify service health** - Are all required services online?
4. **THEN investigate code issues** - Only after confirming basics

#### What I Should Have Done:
1. First question: "Is the PostgreSQL database running on Railway?"
2. Check Railway dashboard for service status
3. Verify database deployment status
4. THEN proceed to code analysis if services are running

#### Impact of This Oversight:
- Wasted time on complex debugging
- Proposed unnecessary code changes
- Nearly reverted valid commits
- Created confusion about desktop app impact

#### Improved Debugging Checklist for Future:
- [ ] Service running? (Database, API, etc.)
- [ ] Deployment successful?
- [ ] Environment variables correct?
- [ ] Network/firewall accessible?
- [ ] THEN check code/configuration issues

**Reminder:** The simplest explanation is often the correct one. Don't overlook basic infrastructure checks in favor of complex code analysis.
